                    Cricket is a religion in India. People go insane when any national or international cricket event is
                organized in India or telecasted. We all complete our work and then get ready to stick to the
                television to enjoy every second of an important match. The long-lasting debates of the fans can be
                witnessed in public places. The huge popularity that our country’s cricket team got is because of an
                excellent captain named Mahendra Singh Dhoni. This essay on Dhoni will tell us how a simple boy from
                Jharkhand got the chance to captain India’s cricket team, the most formidable team in the world.

                    Dhoni was born on 7th July 1981. His parents are Pan Singh and Devaki Dev. They stayed in Ranchi
                (Jharkhand). He has two siblings. His father was a junior manager in Mecon. Dhoni showed immense
                interest in playing football and badminton. Even at the school level, he excelled in both the sports
                and was selected for the district-level competitions. He studied at DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir School
                located in Ranchi. He was an excellent goalkeeper. Watching his eye-catchy skills, his football
                coach sent him to a local cricket club to play cricket.

                    He never played cricket before but he managed to grab the concept perfectly. His wicket-keeping
                skills amazed everyone in the club. He was appointed as the wicketkeeper for the local team on a
                regular basis. Later, he started to focus primarily on cricket and left his glory days of football
                and badminton behind. It was a drastic change in his life. He started to take professional coaching
                after Class X. He was also a meritorious student and teachers respected him for his versatile
                nature. He used to manage his studies and sports sessions perfectly. His family was very supportive
                of his ambitions.
